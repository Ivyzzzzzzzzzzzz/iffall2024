            <l1><p>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</p>
                <p>I've used VS before for Digital Game Design and I'm interested in visual design for 
                    screen and web page. I take this class because it's mandatory and also it's cs related</p>
            </l1>
            <br>
            <l1><p>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</p>
                <p>I've only tried HTML a little bit in Typography I.</p>
            </l1>
            <br>
            <l1><p>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</p>
                <p>I guess I want to learn the basic algorithm about how the back-end works to create a web page. </p>
            </l1>
            <br>
            <l1><p>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</p>
                <p>It has more user-flexibility that user has more freedom to enjoy the thing I built.</p>
            </l1>
            <br>
            <l1><p>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</p>
                <p>Here's the link: <a href="https://www.doordash.com/?ignore_splash_experience=true&&utm_source=Google&utm_medium=SEMb&utm_campaign=CX_US_SE_SB_GO_ACQ_TETXXX_21142159095_RSTRNT_+BR_ACQ_INMKT_GenDeliveryxx_EVG_CPAx_EPX_COUSA_EN_EN_X_DOOR_GO_SE_TXT_ADAIXXXXXX&utm_term=doordash&utm_content=161339104700&kclickid=_k_CjwKCAjwlbu2BhA3EiwA3yXyu167JSaSPG60a6GunXQR4gunCB93VSpBnRtB4dL_y83jGpGJt4F2gxoCCVMQAvD_BwE_k_&utm_adgroup_id=161339104700&utm_creative_id=695355755995&utm_keyword_id=aud-966867198856:kwd-63454401416&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwlbu2BhA3EiwA3yXyu167JSaSPG60a6GunXQR4gunCB93VSpBnRtB4dL_y83jGpGJt4F2gxoCCVMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Link to doordash</a>
                    It's the website for doordash. I found it exemplifies effective design because it doesn't have a tons of clickable actions 
                    on its landing page. The user could easily get focus on the task. Also, the color pallete feels clean and food-oriented.
                </p>

            <br>
            <l1><p>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</p>
                <p>Here's the link: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">Link to nytimes</a> I think New York Times website shows effective communication because it's a 
                    massive-information-gathered website where people with all kinds of infographics will come and find things they needed and interested.
                    It's a challenging work to make every clear and effective. It uses different sizes, values of types to establish a clear hierarchy
                    and separate every topics in the most minimal and easy-understanding way.

            <l1><p>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</p>
                <p>Here's the link: <a href="https://www.koreanair.com/">Link to koreanair</a>. Among all of the ariline companies, I love Korean Airline's web page the most.
                They have the cleanest and the most straight-forward visual and user flow.</p>
