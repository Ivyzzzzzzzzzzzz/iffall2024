            <p>This website has very clear and clean description on ingredients and instructions which is something I want my website be like(minimalistic and gentle).</p>
            <a href="https://www.lastingredient.com/web-stories/peanut-butter-banana-bread/"atl="websire 2">website 2</a>
            <p>I really like the way it shows the instructions. It eliminates lots of distraction and really helps people to focus on what they need to do right now. The centered and card style is also intreresting to interact. </p>
            <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/moist-banana-bread-recipe-995192"atl="websire 3">website 3</a>
            <p>This website has a very comfortable line length. The shorter line length makes me want to follow and feel less overwhelming and frustrating. Also the description is short and straightforward which create less confusion.</p>

            <p>The color palletes and full-rounded corner are two elements that I want to follow with in terms of designing my own recipe website. The orange feels very delicous and tasting. The rounded corner of every button and bar is a personal preference and it makse the overal website feels soft and interesting to interact with. </p>

            <p>This webiste has a very specific and stylistic design. The contrast of font size and value is something I want to achieve in my website. The smallest font size feels very delicate. I also like the tags on the right row which add on more persona to the website. It also has something interesting user respond happening such as zoom in and color shift when there's a hover. I especially love how it embeds the topic (medicine and pills) into the title.</p>

            <p>I love the plyafulness of the design. It's very literal and there's lots of interaction happening around. In her project called <a href="https://www.chloeyan.me/interface-ideas/stroll"atl="stroll">Stroll</a>, everything is very centered. The wide margin on left and right feels very comfortable.  </p>
