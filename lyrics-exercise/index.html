            <hr>
            <p>I saw the sun begin to dim<br>
                And felt that winter wind blow cold<br>
                A man learns who is there for him<br>
                When the glitter fades and the walls won't hold<br>
                <br>
                'Cause from then, rubble<br>
                What remains<br>
                Can only be what's true<br>
                If all was lost<br>
                There's more I gained<br>
                'Cause it led me back<br>
                To you<br>
                <br>
                From now on<br>
                These eyes will not be blinded by the lights<br>
                From now on<br>
                What's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight<br>
                Tonight<br>
                <br>
                Let this promise in me start<br>
                Like an anthem in my heart<br>
                From now on<br>
                From now on<br>
                <br>
                I drank champagne with kings and queens<br>
                The politicians praised my name<br>
                But those are someone else's dreams<br>
                The pitfalls of the man I became<br>            
                <br>
                For years and years<br>
                I chased their cheers<br>
                The crazy speed of always needing more<br>
                But when I stop<br>
                And see you here<br>
                I remember who all this was for<br>
                <br>
                And from now on<br>
                These eyes will not be blinded by the lights<br>
                From now on<br>
                What's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight<br>
                It starts tonight<br>
                And let this promise in me start<br>
                Like an anthem in my heart<br>
                From now on<br>
                From now on<br>
                From now on<br>
                <br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                Home, again!<br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                Home, again!<br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                Home, again!(From now on!)<br>
                <br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                Home, again!<br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                Home, again!<br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                And we will come back home (Yes)<br>
                Home, again!<br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                And we will come back home<br>
                Home, again!<br>
                <br>
                From now on<br>
                These eyes will not be blinded by the lights!<br>
                From now on!<br>
                What's waited 'til tomorrow starts tonight!<br>
                It starts tonight!<br>
                Let this promise in me start<br>
                Like an anthem in my heart<br>
                From now on<br>

                From now on<br>
                <br>
                And we will come back home<br>

                And we will come back home<br>
                And we will come back home<br>
